## AI Content Rewriting

### How It Works

1. **Content Extraction**: The system extracts content from RSS feed items
2. **AI Processing**: Content is sent to Google Gemini AI for rewriting
3. **Style Application**: Content is rewritten according to the selected style
4. **Quality Check**: System ensures content meets minimum length requirements
5. **Publication**: Articles are published or saved as drafts

### AI Rewrite Styles

- **Professional**: Journalistic style suitable for news websites
- **Casual**: Friendly, conversational tone
- **Formal**: Academic, precise language
- **Creative**: Engaging, story-telling approach

### Content Quality

The AI rewriting:
- Maintains factual accuracy
- Improves readability and flow
- Preserves key information
- Adapts to your chosen style
- Keeps similar length to original

## Configuration Options

### Feed Settings

```javascript
{
  enableAiRewrite: true,        // Enable/disable AI rewriting
  aiRewriteStyle: 'professional', // Style: professional, casual, formal, creative
  includeOriginalSource: true,  // Add source attribution
  autoPublish: true,           // Auto-publish or save as drafts
  publishDelay: 0              // Delay in minutes before publishing
}
```

### Processing Limits

- **Minimum Content Length**: 50-1000 characters (default: 100)
- **Maximum Posts Per Day**: 1-50 articles (default: 5)
- **Processing Frequency**: Every 30 minutes (configurable)
- **Error Log Retention**: Last 50 errors per feed

## Error Handling

### Common Errors

1. **Invalid RSS URL**: Feed URL is not accessible or invalid
2. **Content Too Short**: Articles don't meet minimum length requirement
3. **Duplicate Articles**: Articles with same title already exist
4. **AI API Errors**: Google Gemini API issues
5. **Network Errors**: Connection problems

### Error Logging

- Errors are logged with timestamps
- Error types: error, warning, info
- Last 50 errors retained per feed
- Clear error logs option available

## API Endpoints

### RSS Feeds Management

```
GET    /api/rss-feeds          # List all RSS feeds
POST   /api/rss-feeds          # Create new RSS feed
GET    /api/rss-feeds/:id      # Get specific RSS feed
PUT    /api/rss-feeds/:id      # Update RSS feed
DELETE /api/rss-feeds/:id      # Delete RSS feed
```

### RSS Processing

```
POST   /api/rss-feeds/:id/process    # Process specific feed
POST   /api/rss-feeds/process/all    # Process all active feeds
POST   /api/rss-feeds/test           # Test RSS feed URL
```

### Statistics

```
GET    /api/rss-feeds/:id/stats      # Get feed statistics
DELETE /api/rss-feeds/:id/errors     # Clear error logs
```

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Server Logs

Monitor these log messages:
- `üîÑ Processing RSS feeds...`
- `‚úÖ RSS processing completed: X processed, Y published`
- `‚ùå RSS processing errors: [details]`

### Performance Considerations

- Processing runs every 30 minutes
- Each feed is processed independently
- AI API calls are rate-limited
- Error handling prevents system crashes

### Backup and Recovery

- RSS feed configurations are stored in MongoDB
- Error logs help with troubleshooting
- Manual processing available for recovery

## Troubleshooting

### Feed Not Processing

1. Check if feed is active
2. Verify RSS URL is accessible
3. Check error logs for specific issues
4. Ensure minimum content length is met
5. Verify daily post limit hasn't been reached

### AI Rewriting Issues

1. Verify GEMINI_API_KEY is set
2. Check API key permissions
3. Monitor API rate limits
4. Review error logs for API errors

### Performance Issues

1. Reduce processing frequency
2. Lower maximum posts per day
3. Increase minimum content length
4. Monitor server resources

## Best Practices

### RSS Feed Selection

- Choose reliable, well-maintained feeds
- Verify feed URLs are stable
- Test feeds before adding
- Monitor feed quality regularly

### Content Management

- Set appropriate minimum content lengths
- Use reasonable daily post limits
- Choose suitable AI rewrite styles
- Enable source attribution for transparency

### Monitoring

- Regularly check error logs
- Monitor published content quality
- Review feed performance statistics
- Update feed configurations as needed

## Security Considerations

- RSS feeds are processed server-side
- API keys are stored securely
- Error logs don't expose sensitive data
- Processing is rate-limited to prevent abuse

## Support

For issues or questions:
1. Check error logs in the admin panel
2. Review server logs for detailed information
3. Verify environment variable configuration
4. Test RSS feed URLs manually

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
- Custom AI prompts for rewriting
- Advanced content filtering
- Image extraction and processing
- Social media integration
- Analytics and reporting
- Bulk feed import/export
